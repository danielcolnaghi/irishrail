# Irish Rail

Fast Prototype - How to consume Irish Rail API.

The first idea of this prototype is to list available DART to a specific direction and get the real time information to notify the user when is the next DART.

The first part of this prototype was develop in 2hs and the main goal was to create a basic access to API and set MVVM as base architecture.

No auxiliar library was used in this prototype.
No design was defined.
